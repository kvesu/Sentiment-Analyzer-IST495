AA,Jul-02-25 12:35PM,Constellation Projects $20 Million Hit From Aluminum Tariff,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/constellation-sees-20-million-hit-154955817.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Constellation Brands Inc. expects aluminum tariffs to cost the company roughly $20 million over the remainder of its fiscal year, which runs through February. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commutes Resume After Midtown Bus Terminal Crash Chaos Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing Massachusetts to Follow NYC in Making Landlords Pay Broker Fees California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law President Donald Trump’s current 50% duty on imported aluminum, part of his US trade overhaul, directly impacts companies such as Constellation that rely on aluminum cans for packaging. While many alcohol imports from Mexico remain exempt, beer packaged in aluminum is subject to the new levy. The tariff didn’t affect results in the fiscal first quarter that ended May 31, but will weigh on margins going forward, Chief Financial Officer Garth Hankinson said on a call with investors Wednesday. The company doesn’t expect to fully offset the added cost, which will shave about 20 basis points from margins, he said. Related: Alcoa Reports $20 Million Tariff Hit on Imports From Canada The beer division remains Constellation’s biggest moneymaker, but margins have come under pressure amid rising costs and softening demand. “Consumers are not going out to eat as much as they had, they’re having less social occasions at home,” CEO Bill Newlands said on the call. “It doesn’t change their interest in consumption of beer — it simply has been that those occasions have decreased.” Constellation shares rose 4.3% at 12:29 p.m. in New York trading on Wednesday, paring the stock’s year-to-date decline to about 31%. (Updates share trading and adds quote from CEO. An earlier version of this story corrected the percentage of the aluminum tariff.)

AA,Jul-01-25 04:15PM,Alcoa Announces Closing of Maaden Transaction,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250701444443/en/,"Alcoa Announces Closing of Ma’aden Transaction Alcoa receives $1.35 billion of proceeds in Ma’aden shares and cash PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA; ASX: AAI) (“Alcoa” or the “Company”) today announced the successful closing of the Company’s sale of its full ownership interest of 25.1% in the Ma’aden Joint Venture (the “Joint Venture”) to Saudi Arabian Mining Company (“Ma’aden”), pursuant to a binding share purchase and subscription agreement (the “Agreement”). Alcoa received proceeds of approximately 86 million shares of Ma’aden (valued at approximately $1.2 billion) and $150 million in cash (to be used primarily for related taxes and transaction costs) and expects to record a gain of approximately $780 million in other income in the third quarter of 2025. Consistent with prior transactions, Alcoa reflects gains or losses from non-core asset sales as special items. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Alcoa will hold its Ma’aden shares for a minimum of three years and can sell one-third of the shares after each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of closing of the transaction (the “holding period”). During the holding period, Alcoa is permitted, under certain conditions, to hedge and borrow against its Ma’aden shares. Under certain circumstances, such minimum holding period can be reduced. Following the transaction, Alcoa owns approximately 2% of Ma’aden’s current shares outstanding. “While today marks the end of the Joint Venture, the closing of this transaction demonstrates the initial value to our shareholders and enables visibility within Alcoa’s financials until we monetize in the future,” said William F. Oplinger, Alcoa’s President and CEO. “I thank Ma’aden’s leadership and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their partnership over the last 16 years, and we look forward to continued engagement as Ma’aden shareholders.” The Joint Venture was created in 2009 as a fully integrated mining complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and today comprises two entities: the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (“MBAC”; the bauxite mine and alumina refinery) and the Ma’aden Aluminum Company (“MAC”; the aluminum smelter and casthouse). Alcoa previously owned 25.1% of the Joint Venture and Ma’aden owned 74.9%. In connection with the transaction, ​Citi acted as Alcoa’s exclusive financial advisor, and White & Case LLP acted as its legal counsel. About Alcoa Alcoa (NYSE: AA, ASX: AAI) is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products with a vision to reinvent the aluminum industry for a sustainable future.

AAAU,Jul-02-25 12:53PM,ETFs to Capture Market Momentum in the Second Half of 2025,https://finviz.com/news/94602/etfs-to-capture-market-momentum-in-the-second-half-of-2025,"The first half of 2025 proved volatile for investors, marked by geopolitical tensions, tariff-related uncertainty, and other underlying risks. Despite the uncertainty, the S&P 500 managed a gain of approximately 5.7% in the first six months. Sentiment shifted sharply in early April after President Trump paused reciprocal tariffs, sparking a bullish rally that sent the S&P 500 up approximately 25% by the end of the first half.Many economists expect the U.S. market bulls to continue with their momentum going into the second half of 2025. Below, we take a look at sectors that are expected to continue with their momentum into the second half of the year. Investing in cryptocurrencies presents an alternative route for those picking funds as the greenback weakens. Bitcoin has gained 12% in the first half of the year and an impressive 41% since early April. Cryptocurrency, an alternative to traditional currencies, tends to gain from a weaker greenback. The greenback is losing its strength and trading near multi-year lows, marking its worst first-half performance since the 1970s, with both technical and fundamental factors working against the currency. According to TradingView, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen 2.54% over the past month and 11.28% over the past six months. Investors have increased their bets on the pace of interest rate cuts by the Fed. If the Fed goes ahead with an interest rate cut, it could boost investor risk appetite, potentially leading to increased exposure to digital currencies. Additionally, lower interest rates would leave investors with more capital, often leading to increased interest in cryptocurrency. Investors can consider funds likeiShares Bitcoin TrustIBIT,Grayscale Bitcoin TrustGBTC andBitwise Bitcoin ETF TrustBITB. Investors can also look atGrayscaleBitcoin Mini TrustBTC, which is a cheaper alternative to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Performance-wise, BITB appears better, gaining 11.43% over the past month and 54.93% over the past year. Increasing investments in the AI and Tech market created a dominant theme in 2024, and this momentum continues on Wall Street in 2025. This sustained momentum presents a compelling opportunity for investors, as ongoing initiatives and innovation continue to drive growth in the U.S. AI and technology market. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to remain resilient, with global investors planning substantial investments in the U.S. AI market. According to Reuters, Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, is proposing a $1 trillion complex in Arizona focused on developing robotics and AI technologies. This is in addition to President Trump’s announcement in late January regarding ‘Stargate,’ a $500 billion private-sector investment aimed at building AI infrastructure in the United States. With the global AI market projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2031, the market is an attractive investment opportunity. According to Statista, the U.S. AI market is expected to witness a CAGR of 26.95% from 2025 to 2031, reaching a valuation of $309.7 billion by 2031, cementing its position as the largest AI market globally. Investors can consideriShares U.S. Technology ETFIYW,Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETFAIQ andGlobal X Robotics & ArtificialIntelligence ETFBOTZ. Performance-wise, IYW was better over the past month, gaining 10.62% and AIQ had better performance over the past year, adding 21.29%. Investor sentiment remained fragile in the first half of 2025, providing strong tailwinds for gold. Rising geopolitical uncertainty and central banks increasing purchases of the precious metal, have contributed to gold’s sustained appeal. Expectations by some economists that inflation may worsen before easing toward the Fed’s target have kept investor interest in the yellow metal elevated. Gold remains an attractive inflation hedge, as it preserves its purchasing power, outpacing inflation. Gold prices are inversely related to the value of the U.S. dollar and the greenback’s struggles in 2025 has been a tailwind for the yellow metal. A weaker U.S. dollar generally leads to higher demand for gold, pushing its price upward as it becomes more affordable for buyers holding other currencies. The yellow metal gains additional support from expectations of rate cuts by the Fed. The greenback's value tends to move inversely with interest rate adjustments by the Fed. Interest rate cuts by the Fed make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors as this weakens the U.S. dollar. Investors can considerSPDR Gold SharesGLD,iShares Gold TrustIAU,SPDR Gold MiniShares TrustGLDM andGoldman Sachs Physical Gold ETFAAAU to increase their exposure to the yellow metal. The funds have gained about 15.5% over the past three months and 39% over the past year. The only word that can be used to describe the geopolitical landscape in 2025 is 'complicated.' Increased defense spending by global economies has also boosted the sector’s prospects. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military spending rose to $2.72 trillion in 2024, marking a record 9.4% increase over 2023, the sharpest annual rise since the end of the Cold War. Additionally, the shift in warfare technology has resulted in the militarization of space, with economies looking to expand the development of their own space-based arsenal, a trend already gaining momentum. Analysts believe this could unlock major opportunities for U.S. defense firms (Read: Space ETFs for a Portfolio That's Out of this World). The S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense index has gained 47.86% over the past year and 24.13% year to date. Investing in Aerospace and Defense ETFs allows investors to tap the sector’s ongoing momentum.iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETFITA,Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETFPPA,SPDRS&P Aerospace & Defense ETFXAR andGlobal X Defense Tech ETFSHLD can be considered.

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.11% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.91%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.82%. The world's largest airline's stock has dropped by 1.41% in the past month, falling short of the Transportation sector's gain of 2.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.17%. Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of American Airlines in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.77, showcasing a 29.36% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.29 billion, down 0.29% from the year-ago period. In terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $0.81 per share and a revenue of $54.61 billion, indicating changes of -58.67% and +0.74%, respectively, from the former year. Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for American Airlines.  These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends.  With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook. Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.  To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system. The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.55% higher. Right now, American Airlines possesses a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). Looking at its valuation, American Airlines is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 13.84. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 9.79. It is also worth noting that AAL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.26. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Transportation - Airline industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.93 as of yesterday's close. The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 155, finds itself in the bottom 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.

The justices declined to hear the appeal of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department that ended the proposed ""Northeast Alliance,"" which would have allowed the two carriers to coordinate flights and pool revenue. American Airlines had argued that the antitrust violation ruling wrongly showed hostility to business collaboration and contradicted approaches taken by other courts that require evidence of actual harm to consumers in the market as a whole, not just the customers of the collaborating companies. The airline also claimed the ruling invalidated a joint venture that increased market-wide competition among all airlines and ""threatens to wreak havoc on productive collaborations of all shapes and sizes."" The November ruling stemmed from a lawsuit the Justice Department filed in 2021 along with six states during Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, which made boosting airline competition a priority and aggressively enforced U.S. antitrust laws. Despite the change in administrations, the Justice Department under Republican President Donald Trump has continued to defend the government’s victory, stating the 1st Circuit’s ruling upholding a judge’s decision to block the alliance was based on ""uncontroversial antitrust principles.""

AAMI,Jul-03-25 12:00PM,Acadian Asset Management (AAMI) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,https://finviz.com/news/95499/acadian-asset-management-aami-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look atAcadian Asset Management (AAMI), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Acadian Asset Management currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> In order to see if AAMI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this asset manager holds up. Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For AAMI, shares are up 11.41% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry is up 3.35% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 22.5% compares favorably with the industry's 7.02% performance as well. While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Acadian Asset Management have increased 40.86% over the past quarter, and have gained 61.47% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.24% and 14.41%, respectively. Investors should also take note of AAMI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AAMI is averaging 241,693 shares for the last 20 days. The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with AAMI. Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AAMI's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.65 to $3.18 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period. Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that AAMI is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Acadian Asset Management on your short list. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AAMI,Jul-02-25 10:57AM,Does American Express' Minimum SCB Signal Strong Capital Discipline?,https://finviz.com/news/94474/does-american-express-minimum-scb-signal-strong-capital-discipline,"American Express CompanyAXP stated today that the Federal Reserve has set its preliminary Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement at 2.5%, effective from Oct. 1, 2025, through Sept. 30, 2026. The requirement, determined through the 2025 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, represents the regulatory minimum and aligns with the previously disclosed SCB in effect through Sept. 30, 2025. This preliminary SCB is pending final confirmation by the Federal Reserve, expected to be announced by Aug. 31, 2025. This move enhances American Express’ financial position by allowing it to operate with greater capital flexibility. With less capital tied up in regulatory buffers, the company can more efficiently allocate resources toward strategic investments, product innovation and potential shareholder distributions, such as dividends and buybacks. This efficient use of capital can contribute to stronger return on equity and long-term profitability. A testament to this financial strength and capital discipline is American Express’s decision to increase its quarterly dividend on common shares by 17% to 82 cents per share, beginning with the first-quarter 2025 dividend declaration. Additionally, the company returned $5.4 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases over the 12-month period ended March 31, 2025. The return on equity for American Express is currently 32.5%, which is higher than the industry’s average of 16.4%. This substantiates the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Over the year-to-date period, shares of AXP have gained 8.6%, outperforming the industry and the Zacks S&P 500 Index composite index.

(PGY) Moves 9.6% Higher: Will This Strength Last?,https://finviz.com/news/92044/pagaya-technologies-ltd-pgy-moves-96-higher-will-this-strength-last,"Pagaya Technologies Ltd.(PGY) shares rallied 9.6% in the last trading session to close at $21.39. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 13.9% gain over the past four weeks. Shares of Pagaya Technologies rallied for the second straight trading session and touched a new 52-week high of $21.45. The optimism across the broader markets over trade deals and hopes of interest rate cuts sooner than expected turned investors bullish on financial services stocks. As such, PGY stock moved higher on Friday. This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +520%. Revenues are expected to be $298.1 million, up 19.1% from the year-ago quarter. While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For Pagaya Technologies Ltd., the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

""From the onset, this was about more than delivering standard HVAC — it was a collaboration between two teams determined to break away from cookie-cutter solutions,"" saidMatt Tobolski, PhD – AAON CEO & BASX Co-Founder. ""Applied Digital brought us a clear challenge, and we responded with a system engineered from the ground up to meet it. We solve problems at the root and build for what's next, not just what's easy.""

AAON,Jun-29-25 11:31PM,Q1 HVAC and Water Systems Earnings: AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) Earns Top Marks,https://finviz.com/news/91707/q1-hvac-and-water-systems-earnings-aaon-nasdaq-aaon-earns-top-marks,"The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how hvac and water systems stocks fared in Q1, starting with AAON (NASDAQ:AAON). Many HVAC and water systems companies sell essential, non-discretionary infrastructure for buildings. Since the useful lives of these water heaters and vents are fairly standard, these companies have a portion of predictable replacement revenue. In the last decade, trends in energy efficiency and clean water are driving innovation that is leading to incremental demand. On the other hand, new installations for these companies are at the whim of residential and commercial construction volumes, which tend to be cyclical and can be impacted heavily by economic factors such as interest rates. The 9 hvac and water systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q1. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.6% below. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 3.1% on average since the latest earnings results. Backed by two million square feet of lab testing space, AAON (NASDAQ:AAON) makes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment for different types of buildings. AAON reported revenues of $322.1 million, up 22.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 10.9%. Overall, it was an incredible quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates. Gary Fields, CEO, stated, ""We had a strong first quarter. Net sales, gross margin and earnings all experienced quarter-over-quarter improvement. Production of BASX-branded equipment made solid progress as we accelerated backlog conversion, utilizing all four of our major locations, including our new facility in Memphis. The resulting net sales of BASX-branded products for the quarter were up year-over-year 374.8%. Bookings for BASX-branded equipment were also strong, driven by demand for both our air-side and liquid cooling data center equipment, with total backlog at the end of the quarter up 83.9% from a year ago and up 18.4% from the end of last year. "" AAON achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 19.7% since reporting and currently trades at $73.14. We think AAON is a good business, but is it a buy today? Read our full report here, it’s free. With low-pressure heating systems as its first product, Trane (NYSE:TT) designs, manufactures, and sells HVAC and refrigeration systems, the former to commercial and residential building customers and the latter to commercial truck manufacturers.

Originally started as a farm water drainage company, Advanced Drainage Systems (NYSE:WMS) provides clean water management solutions to communities across America. Advanced Drainage reported revenues of $615.8 million, down 5.8% year on year,  falling short of analysts’ expectations by 6.8%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ Infiltrators revenue estimates and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations significantly. Advanced Drainage delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 7.1% since the results and currently trades at $113.06. Read our full analysis of Advanced Drainage’s results here. Claiming to have saved more than 30 billion gallons of water, Zurn Elkay (NYSE:ZWS) provides water management solutions to various industries. Zurn Elkay reported revenues of $388.8 million, up 4% year on year. This result surpassed analysts’ expectations by 1.4%.

In response to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025. Want to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

AAP,Jul-03-25 03:18PM,Why Advance Auto Parts Stock Trounced the Market on Thursday,https://finviz.com/news/95577/why-advance-auto-parts-stock-trounced-the-market-on-thursday,"The company benefited from a pre-market open price target raise. That didn't exactly make the analyst behind it an Advance bull, however. Investors were assertively stepping on the gas pedal withAdvance Auto Parts(NYSE: AAP)on Thursday. The stock closed more than 5% higher as of the 1 p.m. ET early market close for the Fourth of July holiday, a figure that was well higher than theS&P 500's(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)0.8% increase. An analyst price target raise had much to do with Advance's advance. Well before market open that day,Mizuhoprognosticator David Bellinger upped his fair-value assessment of Advance's stock. His new level is $44 per share, up notably from the preceding $38. Despite the fairly generous bump, Bellinger maintained his neutral recommendation on the auto partsretailer. Image source: Getty Images. The analyst's modification was due largely to the company's first-quarter performance, according to reports. On the back of Advance delivering headline fundamentals that were significantly better than the consensus pundit estimates, Bellinger raised his own for full-year 2025 and 2026. For the former period, he now feels that the company will earn $2.34 per share on the bottom line, where previously he had been modeling $2.18. As for 2026, he upped his profitability estimate to $4.00 from $3.75. Bellinger also devoted some words in his new Advance note to intimating why he left his neutral recommendation unchanged. He thinks that the company will continue to have challenges implementing its current turnaround plan. Many retailers, in his estimation, are facing similar difficulties. While there was something to admire in Advance's first-quarter earnings beat, I'd agree with the Mizuho analyst that retail is a tough game these days. I also don't believe we'll see sudden spikes in car sales, a dynamic that tends to inject some turbo into the performance of parts retailers like Advance. Therefore, I wouldn't jump in to this particular ride just now.

AAPL,Today 03:50PM,'Jurassic World Rebirth' Roars to the Top of the Box Office,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/06/business/jurassic-world-rebirth-box-office,"Dinosaurs are alive and well at the box office as Universal’s “Jurassic World Rebirth” trampled competitors, grossing $147 million domestically over five days of the Fourth of July weekend. The fourth installment of the “Jurassic World” series outperformed early estimates of nearly $80 million for the three days and $135 million for the five days. It nearly matched its predecessor from 2022, “Jurassic World Dominion,” which grossed $145 million in its first three days before raking in over $1 billion worldwide. “Jurassic World Rebirth” is another win for Hollywood, which has effectivelyreboundedfrom a sluggish start to 2025. The box office is up more than 14% year-to-date compared with last year, according to Comscore, which collects box office data. The summer season, which Comscore begins tracking on the first Friday in May, is faring even better — up 15% compared to 2024. “Jurassic Park Rebirth” is the seventh film in the franchise, which began with Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” in 1993. The originalmovie would go on to gross $924 million worldwide, or $2 billion when adjusted for inflation. While “Jurassic World” was a new era for the franchise, calling the fourth film “Rebirth,” and casting Scarlett Johansson, likely reinvigorated the brand, according to Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Comscore. “This brand will never go extinct because it continues to thrill audiences,” he said. “It’s most impressive to have a franchise three decades old, topping the chart once again.” “Jurassic World Rebirth” knocked Apple and Warner Bros. Pictures’ “F1” down a peg to No. 2. “F1” grossed $26 million domestically this weekend, a 54% drop from the week prior. The racing movie starring Brad Pitt opened last weekend to roughly $55.6 million domestically and $144 million worldwide. Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN. “‘F1’ is interesting because it’s absolutely killing it at the international box office,” said Dergarabedian. “(It’s) a sport that is more internationally centric than in the United States.” “Jurassic World Rebirth” and “F1” will face fierce competition next week when Warner Bros.’ “Superman” opens in theaters. Analysts expect “Superman” to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend. “The best thing for ‘Superman’ is the success of ‘Jurassic’ and ‘F1.’ The rising tide raises all ships,” said Dergarabedian. Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder and owner of Box Office Theory, said the releases of “Jurassic World Rebirth,” “Superman,” and Disney’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” (July 25) could account for about a quarter of the domestic box office this summer. Robbins added that “F1,” “Jurassic World Rebirth” and “Superman” will likely attract similar audiences of young men. “Superman” could also appeal to families and younger audiences. ”It’s summer. It’s the time when multiple films can coexist, so if any of them are going to do it, this is a good set of movies to pull it off,” he said.",dinosaur alive well box office universal jurassic world rebirth trampled competitor grossing million domestically five day fourth july weekend fourth installment jurassic world series outperformed early estimate nearly million three day million five day nearly matched predecessor jurassic world dominion grossed million first three day raking billion worldwide jurassic world rebirth another win hollywood effectivelyreboundedfrom sluggish start box office year date compared last year according comscore collect box office data summer season comscore begin tracking first friday may faring even better compared jurassic park rebirth seventh film franchise began steven spielberg jurassic park originalmovie would go gross million worldwide billion adjusted inflation jurassic world new era franchise calling fourth film rebirth casting scarlett johansson likely reinvigorated brand according paul dergarabedian senior medium analyst comscore brand never go extinct continues thrill audience said impressive franchise three decade old topping chart jurassic world rebirth knocked apple warner bros picture peg grossed million domestically weekend drop week prior racing movie starring brad pitt opened last weekend roughly million domestically million worldwide warner bros discovery parent company cnn interesting absolutely killing international box office said dergarabedian sport internationally centric united state jurassic world rebirth face fierce competition next week warner bros superman open theater analyst expect superman gross million opening weekend best thing superman success jurassic rising tide raise ship said dergarabedian shawn robbins director analytics fandango founder owner box office theory said release jurassic world rebirth superman disney fantastic four first step july could account quarter domestic box office summer robbins added jurassic world rebirth superman likely attract similar audience young men superman could also appeal family younger audience summer time multiple film coexist going good set movie pull said,0,,,0,,-1.0,0.5,0.13862205959045895,-0.058413382122862297,Negative,0.058413382122862297,206.67,213.55,3.33,Positive ↑,213.55,213.55,,3.33,3.33,,Positive ↑,Positive ↑,Future,1d,3,False,False,False,
AAPL,Jul-05-25 12:11PM,Apple (AAPL) Stock Upgraded to 'Hold' by Jefferies - But Analysts Still Cautious on AI,https://finviz.com/news/96370/apple-aapl-stock-upgraded-to-hold-by-jefferies-but-analysts-still-cautious-on-ai,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the10 Trending AI Stocks on News and Ratings.On July 2, Jefferies upgraded the stock to “Hold” from underperform and raised the price target to roughly $188 per share from $171. Analyst Edison Lee highlighted Apple’s 15% annual growth in sales volume in April and May as a catalyst behind the upgrade. Lee also estimated that iPhone sales grew 19% year over year during the June 18 Chinese shopping holiday. However, he further cautioned that strong June quarter sales could imply slow demand in the September quarter. Apple may also be facing long-term risks, such as a downside in revenue from the App Store, the firm noted. Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, particularly the iPhones and MacBooks.

AAPL,Jul-04-25 12:10PM,Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,https://finviz.com/news/96256/will-apple-aapl-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, could be a great candidate to consider. When looking at the last two reports, this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.09%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the most recent quarter, Apple  was expected to post earnings of $1.65 per share, but it reported $1.61 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.48%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.36 per share, while it actually produced $2.4 per share, a surprise of 1.69%. With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Apple. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates  right before an earnings release  have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Apple has an Earnings ESP of +4.30% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 31, 2025. With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our  Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.

AAPL,Jul-02-25 11:10PM,Can Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Hit $270 in 2025?,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/07a1690a-c29f-3c5c-8649-8159175f78f2/can-taiwan-semiconductor.html,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is off to a strong start in 2025, with TSM stock climbing around 18% year-to-date (YTD). Surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips and a solid first-quarter performance have helped fuel the rally, reinforcing the company’s position at the center of the semiconductor world. With roughly 67% of the global foundry market and about 90% of advanced chip production under its belt, Taiwan Semiconductor remains a go-to manufacturer for cutting-edge chips. The company’s deep ties with tech heavyweights — such as Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), who count on it for manufacturing custom AI accelerators and graphics processing units (GPUs) — continue to be a major growth driver.

Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today! In fact, the stock received a fresh vote of confidence on July 1, when Needham raised its price target to a Street-high $270, citing strong AI-driven growth prospects in the upcoming years. That being said, can the stock continue to rise and reach that ambitious target by 2025? Founded in 1987, Taiwan Semiconductor was the first to establish the pure-play foundry model and has remained the world’s top dedicated semiconductor foundry ever since. The company operates globally across Asia, Europe, and North America. In 2024 alone, Taiwan Semiconductor delivered nearly 12,000 products to over 500 customers, highlighting its broad capabilities in advanced, specialty, and packaging services. Commanding a hefty market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion, shares of the chip giant have performed well this year, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 5.9% return in 2025. Even more impressive, TSM is up 37% over the past three months, easily beating the broader market’s 10% return. Taiwan Semiconductor kicked off fiscal 2025 on a high note, delivering standout first-quarter results on April 17. Revenue soared 35% year-over-year (YOY) to $25.5 billion, edging past Wall Street expectations. Even more impressive, net income jumped 60% to nearly $11 billion. This growth was powered by the booming demand for its advanced 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes. The first-quarter numbers highlight just how dominant the company's advanced chipmaking capabilities have become. Shipments of 3-nanometer chips made up 22% of total wafer revenue, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer chips contributed 36% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, advanced technologies — defined as ""7-nanometer and more advanced technologies"" — accounted for a commanding 73% of total wafer revenue. Profitability was just as impressive. Taiwan Semiconductor reported a gross margin of 58.8%, an operating margin of 48.5%, and a net profit margin of 43.1%, reflecting the strong demand and pricing power that underpin its cutting-edge manufacturing processes. Reflecting on the Q1 performance, CFO Wendell Huang said, “Our business in the first quarter was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Looking ahead, the company is projecting another strong quarter in Q2 2025. Management expects revenue to land between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion, signaling continued growth momentum. The firm is targeting a gross profit margin of between 57% and 59%, with operating margins ranging from 47% to 49%. Taiwan Semiconductor is gearing up to release its Q2 earnings on July 17. Taiwan Semiconductor was in the spotlight earlier this week after Needham analyst Charles Shi boosted his price target on the stock to a Street-high $270, up from $225, while maintaining a “Buy” rating. Shi expressed confidence in the firm’s outlook for $90 billion in AI-related revenue by 2029, noting that the company may not require substantial unit volume growth to hit that goal. Instead, the analyst pointed to increased silicon content per package, driven by more compute dies and the shift to custom HBM base dies, as key factors supporting sustained AI revenue growth over the next four years. Overall, Wall Street’s confidence in TSM shows no signs of fading, as analysts continue to rally behind the stock with a bullish “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Of the 11 analysts offering recommendations, eight advocate for a solid “Strong Buy"" rating, two suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining analyst gives a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $233.12 is on par with current levels. However, Needham’s Street-high target of $270 suggests the stock can rally as much as 16% from current levels. Driven by accelerating AI demand, strong financial performance, and growing Wall Street confidence, Taiwan Semiconductor appears well on track to reach the $270 mark.

AARD,Jul-01-25 05:31PM,Aardvark's Hunger-Suppressing Drug Promises Weight Loss Without GI Distress,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aardvarks-hunger-suppressing-drug-promises-213130470.html,"Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. HC Wainwrightinitiated coverage onAardvark Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:AARD) on Monday with a Buy rating and aprice forecast of $40. In February,Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.(NASDAQ:AARD) priced an initial public offering of 5.9 million at $16 per share, with approximately$94.2 million in gross proceeds. Aardvark is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops novel, small-molecule therapeutics to activate innate homeostatic pathways for metabolic diseases. Trending: GoSun's Breakthrough Rooftop EV Charger Already Has 2,000+ Units Reserved —Become an Investor in This $41.3M Clean Energy Brand Today Aardvark’s lead product candidate, ARD-101, targets Bitter Taste Receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed in the gut lumen, inducing secretion of endogenous signaling molecules, including the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which in turn activates gut-brain signals to suppress the sensation of hunger. Unlike many existing obesity treatments that act systemically and can cause significant gastrointestinal (GI) side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, ARD-101 targets specific receptors in the gut. ARD-101 aims to reduce hunger and facilitate weight loss without the typical systemic side effects. Importantly, its gut-restricted nature means minimal systemic exposure, potentially minimizing off-target effects and preserving lean muscle mass, which is a common concern with some weight loss methods. The drug candidate has entered Phase 3 development for hyperphagia associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Data readout is expected in early 2026. The company holds Orphan Drug Designation for ARD-101 in PWS. See Also: Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market.Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential. Aardvark believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with the proceeds from the IPO, will be sufficient to fund projectedoperations into 2027. Analyst Raghuram Selvaraju noted that there is only one branded medication currently approved in PWS, namely, Vykat XR (diazoxide choline extended-release), launched in April 2025, which has a list price of over $466K in the U.S. Accordingly, the analyst feels that the pricing and competitive landscape dynamics appear favorable, even if the target patient population is small (roughly 20K patients in the U.S.) FDA approvedSoleno Therapeutics, Inc.'s(NASDAQ:SLNO) Vykat XR (diazoxide choline) extended-release tablets, previously referred to as DCCR, for hyperphagia in adults and children 4 years of age and older with PWS. Selvaraju believes that “ARD-101 could achieve robust market share even if it does not have comparable or superior efficacy to existing approved agents, if it proves the hypothesis that the mechanism of action ought to yield significantly better safety and tolerability (particularly with respect to GI side effects).” Beyond Prader-Willi Syndrome, ARD-101 is also being evaluated in the Phase 2 HONOR trial for patients with hypothalamic obesity (HO). The analyst views ARD-101 as an “intriguing treatment alternative for HO patients because of its oral route of administration and benign safety profile.” Hypothalamic obesity is a challenging condition with limited approved treatments.

The increase in the AUM balance was due to the positive impact of markets, which was partially offset by preliminary long-term net outflows of $1 billion, inclusive of $4 billion of long-term net outflows at Western Asset Management. Franklin recorded equity assets of $656.1 billion, which increased 4% from the previous month. The fixed income AUM of $441.3 billion at the end of June 2025 increased marginally from the prior month. Alternative AUM decreased slightly from the prior month to $254 billion. Multi-asset AUM was $183 billion, up 2.6% from May 2025. Additionally, the cash management balance was $71.9 billion, up 1.3% from the previous month. June showed improvement for BEN, with total AUM growth driven by positive markets despite net outflows. However, the slight drop in alternative AUM remains a concern, despite a modest rise in fixed income AUM. Nonetheless, Franklin’s inorganic expansion efforts continue to support its financials. Over the past six months, BEN shares have gained 24.4%, against the industry’s decline of 3.3%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Franklin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

AB,Jul-02-25 08:00AM,3 AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds to Navigate Market Volatility,https://finviz.com/news/94137/3-alliancebernstein-mutual-funds-to-navigate-market-volatility,"A merger in the year 2000 brought together Alliance Capital’s capabilities in growth equity and corporate fixed income and Bernstein’s expertise in value equity and tax-exempt fixed income to form AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. AB, one of the most trusted investment management companies in the world. Headquartered in Nashville, TN, AllianceBernstein has approximately $803 billion in assets under management as of May 31, 2025. The company is recognized for its comprehensive research and diverse investment services offered worldwide to a varied client base, which includes institutional, individual and private wealth clients. From actively managed equity and fixed income funds to asset allocation and ESG-oriented strategies, the firm provides solutions for a wide range of investment goals. The firm is known for placing a strong emphasis on deep fundamental analysis, combining macroeconomic insights with rigorous bottom-up security selection. This allows its investment teams to make well-informed decisions rooted in data. The company currently has more than 4,300 employees across 52 locations in 26 countries. On April 24, AB reported first-quarter earnings of 80 cents/share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents, delivering an earnings surprise of 2.6%. Its revenues of $838.2 million, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $861.6 million, representing a negative surprise of 2.7%. AllianceBernstein, on its latest earnings call, suggested that the firm’s private assets under management could reach between $90 billion and $100 billion by 2027. The firm expects a gradual easing of interest rates through 2025, which could improve fixed-income total returns and lead to a broader rotation within equity markets. AB’s leadership believes that the era of mega-cap tech dominance will begin to broaden, creating opportunities in undervalued or overlooked segments. New initiatives, such as the launch of an interval fund and the growth of the active ETF business, are also expected to do well. Thus, investing in mutual funds from AllianceBernstein may provide the much-needed stability and growth potential in a market that is expected to remain volatile for a while. Hence, astute investors should consider such funds at present. Mutual funds, in general, reduce transaction costs and diversify portfolios without an array of commission charges that are mostly associated with stock purchases (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money). We have thus selected three mutual funds that boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), have positive three-year and five-year annualized returns and minimum initial investments within $5000, as well as carry a low expense ratio. AB Large Cap ValueABVIX invests primarily in a varied portfolio of domestic, large-cap companies that the fund advisor believes are undervalued.

ABAT,Jul-01-25 09:46AM,ABTCs Tonopah Flats lithium project gains US priority status,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ac8589b9-78dd-3248-8cb4-2ecb3021ad8f/abtc%E2%80%99s-tonopah-flats-lithium.html,"The American Battery Technology Company (ABTC) has announced that the US Federal Permitting Council has selected its Tonopah Flats lithium facility as a transparency priority. This priority project status underscores the project's vital contribution to domestic lithium production and bolstering US energy independence. It facilitates fast-tracking the federal permitting process of the domestic lithium mine and refinery, located on the project site in the state of Nevada. Now featured on the FAST-41 permitting dashboard, the project is a national priority, reflecting its strategic importance. ABTC CEO Ryan Melsert stated: “We are excited by this selection of our Tonopah Flats lithium project as a FAST-41 critical mineral transparency project. “As we are currently working through permitting efforts with multiple federal agencies for the construction of this domestic critical mineral project, the support to coordinate and fast-track these efforts is greatly appreciated.” With one of the largest identified claystone resource deposits in the US, the project is integral to meeting the rising demand for lithium, a key component in high-tech applications, from energy storage and defence systems to electronic vehicles. Situated on land managed by the US Department of Interior, the project has also secured a $58m grant from the US Department of Energy for its initial construction phase. ABTC has received a letter of interest from the Export-Import Bank of the United States for $900m in financing, aimed at expanding this commercial-scale lithium mine and refinery. ABTC's alignment with the Make More in America initiative and the China and Transformational Export Program reflects strategic efforts to counter competition from China and ensure US leadership in critical mineral manufacturing. These initiatives align withPresident Trump's Executive Order from 20 March 2025, which mandates federal agencies to streamline the permitting process and facilitate funding and offtake agreements for critical mineral production. In April 2024, ABTC updated its initial assessment in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, confirming Tonopah Flats as one of the largest known lithium resources in the US. The company has already demonstrated the capability to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from claystone at its pilot plant. This success is the foundation for a commercial-scale refinery, partnered with Black & Veatch, aiming to produce 30,000 tonnes (t) of lithium hydroxide annually. Unlike conventional lithium sources, the US lacks large quantities of hard rock spodumene and lithium-rich brines. ABTC has innovated low-cost, low-impact technologies to extract lithium from Nevada's claystone materials, aiming to boost domestic production of battery-grade lithium materials.

ABAT,Jun-30-25 09:37AM,American Battery Technology Company's Tonopah Flats Lithium Project Selected by Trump Administration for Fast-Track Permitting as Critical Mineral Priority Project,https://finviz.com/news/92111/american-battery-technology-companys-tonopah-flats-lithium-project-selected-by-trump-administration-for-fast-track-permitting-as-critical-mineral-priority-project,"Reno, Nev., June  30, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Battery Technology Company(NASDAQ: ABAT), an integrated critical battery materials company commercializing both the development of primary battery minerals and the recycling of lithium-ion batteries, is pleased to announce that itsTonopah Lithium Flats Project(TFLP) has been selected as a Transparency Priority Project by theU.S. Federal Permitting Council.This designation highlights the projects critical role in advancing domestic critical mineral lithium production and supporting U.S. energy independence. The project is now featured on theFAST-41 Permitting Dashboard, underscoring its importance as a national priority. “We are excited by this selection of our Tonopah Flats Lithium Project as a FAST-41 critical mineral Transparency Project,” stated American Battery Technology Company CEO Ryan Melsert. “As we are currently working through permitting efforts with multiple federal agencies for the construction of this domestic critical mineral project, the support to coordinate and fast-track these efforts is greatly appreciated.” For ABTC’s Tonopah Flats Lithium Project, this distinction marks a significant milestone in its development. Situated in central Nevada, the project encompasses one of the largest identified claystone resource deposits in the United States, and has the foundation to play a pivotal role in addressing the nation's growing needs for onshoring battery-grade lithium, an essential component in the production of advanced energy storage, defense systems, medical devices, electronic vehicles, and consumer electronics.“This is an exciting time as we work with our colleagues across the federal government to unleash America’s vast energy and mineral resources.” said Emily Domenech, Permitting Council Executive Director, in a press releaseTrump Administration Announces Addition of Three New Critical Mining Projects to the Federal Permitting Dashboardhighlighting ABTC’s Tonopah Flats Lithium Project as one of the council’s newest listings. “The Permitting Council stands ready to bring the transparency of our program to these projects, speeding the production of the critical minerals needed for our national and economic security.” The designation as a Priority Project is especially beneficial when a company is engaged with multiple federal agencies for project permitting.  The TFLP is located on land managed by the US Department of Interior, while the project has also received a competitive $58 million grant to support the construction of the first phase of this project by the U.S. Department of Energy, and ABTC recently received a Letter of Interest (LOI) from theExport-Import Bank of the United States(EXIM) for $900 million in financing to support the subsequent expansion of this commercial-scale lithium mine and refinery. ABTC's Tonopah Flats Project is strongly aligned with EXIM’s “Make More in America” initiative as well as its “China and Transformational Export Program,” both of which provide beneficial financing terms for U.S. companies facing competition from the People’s Republic of China to ensure the United States leads in certain critical export areas, including the domestic manufacturing of critical minerals. The Fast 41 Transparency Project selection and the issuance of the U.S. EXIM LOI is aligned with President Trump’s Executive Order from March 20, 2025, titled “Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production” which directs federal agencies, including EXIM, to unlock permitting, funding, and offtake agreements for domestic critical mineral manufacturing facilities. The Executive Order includes near-term actions to be determined and implemented by the agencies to fast-track permits, mobilize capital for mineral producers, and create offtake agreements for strategic stockpiling for minerals critical to the United States’ defense, technology, and energy. In accordance with SEC guidelines, in April 2024, ABTC published its amendedInitial Assessment*, which presents the technical and economic study of this project and concluded that this resource is one of the largest known lithium resources in the United States.The company has already successfully demonstrated its internally-developed technologies and manufactured battery-grade lithium hydroxide at its multi-tonne per day pilot demonstration plant from claystone collected from its Tonopah Flats Lithium resource site. This success serves as the foundation for the development of a commercial-scale lithium hydroxide refinery, which is designed to manufacture 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually. The design and construction of this facility are being led inpartnership with global engineering firm Black & Veatch, leveraging the blueprint established by ABTC’s pilot operations. Throughout the world lithium products are generally manufactured from conventional feedstock resources, which include hard rock spodumene materials primarily from western Australia and lithium-rich brines primarily from South America; however, the U.S. does not have large quantities of these conventional resources. As a result, to significantly increase U.S. production of battery grade lithium products, ABTC has developed its own low-cost and low-impact technologies to access the lithium within unconventional lithium-rich claystone material that is found in central Nevada to manufacture these battery grade lithium materials domestically.ABTC’s Tonopah Flats Lithium Project underscores its mission to lead the sustainable advancement of domestic critical minerals and secure a pivotal role in meeting the U.S.’s growing demand for domestically produced critical mineral lithium. By prioritizing innovation, collaboration, and environmentally responsible practices, ABTC is strengthening the domestic critical mineral supply chain.About Federal Permitting Council and Fast 41Established in 2015 by Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41), the Permitting Council is a federal agency charged with improving the transparency and predictability of the federal environmental review and authorization process for certain critical infrastructure projects. The Permitting Council is comprised of the Permitting Council Executive Director, who serves as the Council Chair; 13 federal agency Council members (including deputy secretary-level designees of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Army, Commerce, Interior, Energy, Transportation, Defense, Homeland Security, and Housing and Urban Development, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chairs of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation); and the Chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Permitting Council coordinates federal environmental reviews and authorizations for projects that seek and qualify for FAST-41 coverage. FAST-41 covered projects are entitled to comprehensive permitting timetables and transparent, collaborative management of those timetables on the Federal Permitting Dashboard. FAST-41 covered projects may be in the energy production, electricity transmission, energy storage, surface transportation, aviation, ports and waterways, water resource, broadband, pipelines, manufacturing, mining, carbon capture, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and machine learning, high-performance computing and advanced computer hardware and software, quantum information science and technology, data storage and data management, and cybersecurity sectors.Transparency Projects:A transparency project is not a FAST-41 covered project, but rather a project that the Executive Director directs the lead agency to post to the Permitting Dashboard for transparency purposes. These projects receive the “transparency” that is at the core of the FAST-41 process but do not receive the other benefits of FAST-41 coverage, including the development of a coordinated project plan and dedicated project management by Permitting Council experts.About American Battery Technology CompanyAmerican Battery Technology Company (ABTC), headquartered in Reno, Nevada, has pioneered first-of-kind technologies to unlock domestically manufactured and recycled battery metals critically needed to help meet the significant demand from the electric vehicle, stationary storage, and consumer electronics industries.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are “forward-looking statements.” Although the American Battery Technology Company’s (the “Company”) management believes that such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee that such expectations are, or will be, correct. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company’s future results to differ materially from those anticipated. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks and uncertainties related to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; interpretations or reinterpretations of geologic information, unfavorable exploration results, inability to obtain permits required for future exploration, development or production, general economic conditions and conditions affecting the industries in which the Company operates; the uncertainty of regulatory requirements and approvals; fluctuating mineral and commodity prices, final investment approval and the ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additional information regarding the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of the information contained or referenced in this press release. Additional Technical InformationInitial AssessmentAn Initial Assessment is a preliminary technical and economic study of the economic potential of all or parts of mineralization to support the disclosure of mineral resources. The Initial Assessment must be prepared by a qualified person and must include appropriate assessments of reasonably assumed technical and economic factors, together with any other relevant operational factors, that are necessary to demonstrate at the time of reporting that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. An Initial Assessment is required for disclosure of mineral resources but cannot be used as the basis for disclosure of mineral reserves. An Initial Assessment is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied that would enable them to be classified as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the economic results of an initial assessment will be realized. The mineral resource estimates presented in the ABTC Tonopah Flats Initial Assessment were performed by third-party, qualified person RESPEC, LLC and were classified by geological and quantitative confidence in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-K 1300. Identified resources included Inferred, Indicated, and Measured Resources.Inferred ResourceInferred Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an Inferred Mineral Resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Because an Inferred Mineral Resource has the lowest level of geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of the modifying factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability, an Inferred Mineral Resource may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project, and may not be converted to a mineral reserve.Indicated ResourceIndicated Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an Indicated Mineral Resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because an Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than the level of confidence of a Measured Mineral Resource, an Indicated Mineral Resource may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve.Measured ResourceMeasured Mineral Resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a Measured Mineral Resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because a Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than the level of confidence of either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource, a Measured Mineral Resource may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.",reno nev june globe newswire american battery technology company nasdaq abat integrated critical battery material

These healthcare leaders should continue to perform well and reward shareholders with dividend increases for a long time. Read on to find out more. Image source: Getty Images. AbbVie is apharmaceutical leaderwith a large portfolio of approved products, none more important than a duo of immunology medicines: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In the first quarter, the company's revenue increased by 8.4% year over year to $13.3 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.46, 6.5% higher than the year-ago period. These results are all the more impressive considering AbbVie faced a major patent cliff just two years ago; however, it has since recovered, largely thanks to Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The former generated $3.4 billion in sales during the period, representing a 70.5% year-over-year increase. Rinvoq's revenue came in at $1.7 billion, 57.2% higher than the year-ago period. Management predicts their combined annual sales will exceed $31 billion by 2027. Not only is that significantly higher than the $17.7 billion they racked up last year, it's also $4 billion higher than their previous guidance. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are expected to drive top-line growth well into the 2030s. Although they will eventually lose patent protection, they demonstrate AbbVie's ability to navigate even the biggest patent cliffs, a quality that is essential for any pharmaceutical company to thrive over the long term. AbbVie has other products that help drive revenue growth, and, equally important, it has a deep pipeline that it routinely strengthens through acquisitions. In March, the company announced a licensing deal with Denmark-based Gubra A/S for GUB014295, an investigational weight management therapy. AbbVie paid $350 million up front for this candidate, with potential milestones of $1.9 billion, not including royalties. AbbVie entered the fast-growing weight loss market with this move; GUB014295 might not pan out, but AbbVie's large pipeline, with approximately 90 products in development, should allow it to launch brand-new products frequently, navigate patent cliffs, and remain successful over the long run. Now turning to the company's dividend, AbbVie has increased its payouts by 310% since 2013. And counting the time it spent under Abbott Laboratories' name, AbbVie is aDividend Kingwith 53 consecutive years of payout increases. These facts, from AbbVie's underlying business to the company's dividend track record, point to a company capable of sustaining a passive income program for a long time. Abbott Laboratories is best known for its leadership in the medical device space, where it markets dozens of products across multiple therapeutic areas. The company also operates a diagnostic business and has a presence in the pharmaceutical and nutrition industries. Abbott Laboratories' operations are diversified, which can help it overcome challenges in specific segments. That's one of the company's strengths. Here's another: Abbott Laboratories has been a leader in the highly regulatedhealthcare sectorfor decades. The company has built a solid reputation with physicians and consumers, all of whom are more likely to gravitate toward the brands they know and trust. In the medical device field, Abbott is a trusted brand. And thanks to its vast portfolio, it generates consistent revenue and earnings. Abbott's biggest growth driver in recent years has been its diabetes care segment, led by its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) franchise, the FreeStyle Libre. As the company noted, the FreeStyle Libre has become the most successful medical device in history in terms of dollar sales. That's no small feat. Yet there is still massive whitespace ahead, since only a small portion of the world's diabetics use CGM technology despite its advantages. Abbott's work in this niche should provide a powerful long-term tailwind, but there will be many others. The company boasts other growth drivers, including its structural heart segment, where it markets a range of successful devices, such as its MitraClip device, a leader in its mitral valve repair niche. Beyond any single product, Abbott Laboratories has a proven track record as an innovator and should continue launching newer and better ones. Lastly, Abbott is also a Dividend King, and over the past decade, it has increased its payouts by almost 146%. Abbott Laboratories' business is built to last. Investors who purchase the company's shares today can expect consistent dividend growth over the long term.

ABBV,Jul-05-25 05:41AM,Want Decades of Passive Income? 3 Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever,https://finviz.com/news/96292/want-decades-of-passive-income-3-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold-forever,"AbbVie is a Dividend King with solid growth prospects. Enbridge is a leading pipeline operator and natural gas utility with an ultra-high dividend yield. Realty Income pays monthly dividends that are highly reliable. There's a strong parallel between investing for passive income and planting an apple tree. Both require some work up front. But if all goes well, you can reap the fruits of those labors (literally, in the case of the apple tree) for years afterward. Of course, there are some potential pitfalls. An apple tree could become diseased and stop bearing fruit. Similarly, the companies you invest in could struggle and stop distributing income. The good news for investors is that selecting the right dividend stocks can minimize the risk of that happening. Want decades of passive income? Here are three stocks to buy now and hold forever. Image source: Getty Images. If you're looking for the companies with the best dividend track records, you'll want to check out the elite group of stocks known as theDividend Kings. The list includes over 50 stocks. I thinkAbbVie(NYSE: ABBV)ranks as one of the best. Many of the Dividend Kings don't offer kingly yields. However, AbbVie does. At its current share price, the drugmaker's forward dividend yield stands at 3.5%. Moreover, AbbVie has increased its payouts annually for 53 consecutive years. It has more than quadrupled its dividend since its spinoff fromAbbott Laboratoriesin 2013. You'll get more than just a dividend with AbbVie, though. The company should have solid growth prospects thanks to rising stars such as Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta. AbbVie's pipeline looks promising as well, with around 90 programs in clinical development, roughly 50 of which are in mid- or late-stage testing. Perhaps the most impressive thing about AbbVie, other than its dividend, is the company's resilience. Not long ago, it faced the loss of patent exclusivity for its top-selling product, the autoimmune disease drug Humira. Today, the company has two successors treatments to Humira that together are on track to be even bigger winners. Want even more passive income? Consider investing inEnbridge(NYSE: ENB). At its current share price, this midstream energy leader offers a forward dividend yield that's a hair over 6%. And while Enbridge isn't a Dividend King like AbbVie, it has increased its payouts annually for an impressive 30 consecutive years. Like AbbVie, Enbridge has a highly resilient business. Around 80% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) are protected against inflation. Less than 1% of its EBITDA is tied to volatile commodity prices. Roughly 98% of its EBITDA is either regulated or contracted via take-or-pay agreements (where buyers commit to either purchase products or pay a penalty if they don't). Enbridge is one of the biggest midstream energy companies. Its pipelines transport around 30% of the crude oil produced in North America and 40% of total U.S. crude oil imports. It also transports close to 20% of all natural gas used in the U.S. In addition, thanks to some strategic acquisitions in 2023, Enbridge now ranks as the largest natural gas utility in North America by volume. This helps lower the company's risk level even more. I think Enbridge's utility business also makes the passive income the company generates more dependable. Realty Income(NYSE: O)stacks up pretty well with Enbridge when it comes to dividends. The real estate investment trust (REIT) pays a forward dividend yield of 5.6% at the current share price. Realty Income has also boosted its dividend annually for 30 consecutive years. Another attribute that will appeal to many investors is that Realty Income distributes its dividends monthly rather than quarterly. It even trademarked the name ""The Monthly Dividend Company."" Realty Income has a strong tenant base, leasing properties to 1,598 different clients across 91 industries. Its triple-net leases generate nearly 100% gross margins since its tenants are responsible for covering major property expenses such as insurance, maintenance, property taxes, and utilities. These leases are also usually long, which provides the REIT with consistent, recurring revenue. I also like Realty Income's long-term growth prospects. The company targets a total addressable market of around $14 trillion. More than 60% of this market is in Europe, where Realty Income faces only two major rivals.

ABBV,Jul-03-25 09:30AM,Is It Worth Investing in AbbVie (ABBV) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,https://finviz.com/news/95311/is-it-worth-investing-in-abbvie-abbv-based-on-wall-streets-bullish-views,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important? Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say aboutAbbVie(ABBV) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage. AbbVie currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy. Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.6% and 7.1% of all recommendations. Check price target & stock forecast for AbbVie here>>> While the ABR calls for buying AbbVie, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential. Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation. In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision. In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures. The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5. It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them. On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns. Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements. In terms of earnings estimate revisions for AbbVie, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $12.28. Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for AbbVie. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for AbbVie.

These rare giants provide not only consistent income but also long-term stability. Dividend giants are typically well-established companies with strong cash flows, resilient business models, and a long history of rewarding shareholders, which can help safeguard your portfolio. 3 Giant Dividend Stocks to Buy to Shield Your Portfolio Now 3 Overlooked Dividend Aristocrats To Buy in 2025 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. Valued at nearly $328 billion, AbbVie (ABBV) is a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company focused on treating autoimmune disorders, cancers, neurological conditions, and aesthetic medical needs. Its strong cash flow, innovative research, and diverse portfolio of leading medicines position it as a global leader in both prescription therapeutics and aesthetics. AbbVie has a forward dividend yield of 3.5%, which is higher than the healthcare sector average of 1.58%. While the yield is appealing, a reasonable payout ratio indicates how much of its net income the company distributes as dividends while leaving enough to reinvest in the business. Its forward payout ratio of 46.9% is relatively low, indicating that dividend payments are sustainable and have room to grow. AbbVie is also a Dividend King, having paid and increased dividends for 53 straight years. AbbVie is best known for its blockbuster drug Humira, which treats autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis. However, to deal with Humira’s patent expiration, the company has expanded its portfolio to include blockbuster drugs such as Skyrizi (for psoriasis and Crohn’s) and Rinvoq (for rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis). In the most recent first quarter, Skyrizi’s sales stood at $3.4 billion, up 70.5%, while Rinvoq’s were $1.7 billion, up 57.2%. Adjusted earnings increased 6.5% in the quarter. Overall, Wall Street has assigned a “Moderate Buy” rating to AbbVie stock. Out of 27 analysts covering the stock, 14 have a “Strong Buy” rating, two suggest a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 11 recommend a “Hold” rating. The mean target price for ABBV is $208.88, which is 10% above its current levels. Its high price estimate of $250 implies potential upside of 33% over the next 12 months. AT&T (T) is a major American telecommunications company with a market capitalization of $208 billion. It offers wireless services, internet and broadband services, TV and streaming services, as well as business and enterprise solutions like network connectivity, cybersecurity, and cloud services. AT&T offers an attractive forward dividend yield of 3.85%, which is significantly higher than the communications sector average of 2.6%. Importantly, the company’s forward payout ratio has improved to 49.7%, thanks to a simpler business model and strong free cash flow (FCF). In the first quarter, the company generated $3.1 billion in FCF, paying out dividends totaling $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per share rose by 6.3% in Q1. Furthermore, it expects to generate more than $16 billion in FCF by 2025, which should support dividend payouts. Overall, Wall Street rates AT&T stock as a ""Moderate Buy.” Of the 28 analysts covering the stock, 17 recommend a ""Strong Buy,” three recommend a “Moderate Buy,” seven rate it a ""Hold,” and one suggests a “Strong Sell.” Currently, the stock is trading close to its average analyst target price of $29.21. Its high price target of $34, however, represents upside potential of 17.5% over the next 12 months. Valued at $45 billion, Target (TGT) is a major American retail company. Target is known for its low prices, trendy private-label brands, and excellent in-store and online shopping experiences. It also provides same-day delivery and curbside pickup. Target is part of the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, a group of S&P 500 Index ($SPX) companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Target has raised its dividend annually for over 54 consecutive years as of 2025, also putting it in the even more exclusive Dividend Kings club. It recently increased its dividend by 1.8%. The company pays an attractive dividend yield of 4.4%, which is significantly higher than the consumer staples average of 1.9%. Behind every reliable dividend payer is a strong financial engine. While consumer spending can fluctuate, Target’s business model enables it to adapt quickly. During a recession, consumers often migrate from premium retailers to value-oriented stores, giving Target a competitive edge. Target’s adjusted earnings for the first quarter increased 11.8% to $2.27 per share. The company’s payout ratio is within a sustainable range of 56.8%. This means Target has enough room to continue rewarding shareholders while reinvesting in its operations. Overall, Wall Street rates Target stock as a ""Moderate Buy.” Of the 34 analysts covering the stock, eight recommend a ""Strong Buy,” three say it is a “Moderate Buy,” 21 rate it a ""Hold,” and two suggest a “Strong Sell.” Based on its average analyst target price of $110.25, the stock has upside potential of 10.9% from current levels. Plus, its high price target of $175 represents upside potential of 77.4% over the next 12 months.

In Entertainment, DIS expects double-digit segment operating income growth in fiscal 2025. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2025 net sales to increase 3.7% from fiscal 2024.However, Disney+’s profitability is expected to be hurt by higher investments in content, which will also increase programming and production costs in the Entertainment segment. For fiscal Q3, Disney expects a modest increase in its Disney+ subscriber base on a sequential basis. Disney's declining ad revenues is an overhang. The company's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.(You canread the full research report on Walt Disney here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana Inc.

Stock indexes are climbing today, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posting new all-time highs, and the Dow Jones Industrials posting a 4-1/4 month high.  Positive trade news is boosting stocks today with President Trump's July 9 deadline fast approaching.  Progress is being made in trade negotiations with China and the European Union.  Also, trade talks are back on with Canada after the country withdrew a digital services tax, and India's and Japan's trade teams extended their stay in Washington to iron out new trade deals. Holiday Trading, Trade Negotiations and Other Key Things to Watch this Week Options Flow Alert: Bulls Making Their Move in GOOGL Stock Stocks Set to Open Higher Amid Trade Progress, U.S. Jobs Data and Powell’s Remarks Awaited Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. Negotiations over President Trump's spending and tax bill are continuing, with the dollar index sliding to a new 3-1/4-year low today, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the measure would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US deficits over the next ten years. M&A activity is also supportive for stocks after Home Depot announced it has acquired GMS Inc. for $4.3 billion and AbbVie agreed to buy Capstan Therapeutics for $2.1 billion. Better-than-expected economic news from China is supportive of global economic growth prospects. The China June manufacturing PMI rose +0.2 to 49.7, stronger than expectations of 49.6.  Also, the June non-manufacturing PMI rose +0.2 to 50.5, stronger than expectations of no change at 50.3. On the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week. Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of 2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research. During this holiday-shortened week, the markets will look for additional trade and tariff news along with progress in the passage of President Trump's tax bill.  On Tuesday, the June ISM manufacturing index is expected to climb by +0.2 to 48.7.  Also, on Tuesday.  May JOLTS job openings are expected to fall -91,000 to 7.3 million.  Finally on Tuesday, Fed Chair Powell participates in a panel discussing monetary policy with BOE Governor Bailey, ECB President Lagarde, and BOJ Governor Ueda.  On Wednesday, the June ADP employment change is expected to rise by +90,000.  On Thursday, Jun nonfarm payrolls are expected to climb by +113,000 and the June employment rate is expected to tick up +0.1 to 4.3%.  Also, June average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y. In addition, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb +5,000 to 241,000, and May factory orders are expected to jump +8.1% m/m.  Finally, the Jun ISM services index is expected to climb +0.7 to 50.6. Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 19% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting. Overseas stock markets today are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell from a 2-week high and is down -0.09%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.59%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rose to an 11-1/2 month high and closed up +0.84%. Interest Rates September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up by +5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.8 bp to 4.259%. T-note prices are moving higher today on some positive carryover from strength in European government bonds.  Also, positive trade news today bolstered hopes for smaller-than-expected tariffs, which eased inflation concerns.  However, today's rally in the S&P 500 to a new record high reduced safe-haven demand for government securities, which was bearish for T-notes. European government bond yields today are moving lower.  The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.3 bp to 2.578%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -0.6 bp to 4.498%. German May retail sales unexpectedly fell -1.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of a +0.5% m/m increase and the biggest decline in more than 2-1/2 years. The German June CPI (EU harmonized) rose +0.2% m/m and +1.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m and +1.8% y/y. ECB Vice President Guindos said the Eurozone economy is stalling because of the ""brutal uncertainty"" surrounding global trade policy and that second and third quarter growth ""will be almost flat."" Swaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting. US Stock Movers Bank stocks are climbing today after news last Friday that the biggest US banks all cleared the Fed's annual stress test, which could prompt the banks to boost buybacks and dividends for shareholders.  As a result, Goldman Sachs (GS) is up more than +2% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials.  Also, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) are up more than +1%. GMS Inc. (GMS) is up more than +11% after Home Depot agreed to buy the company for $4.3 billion or about $110 per share. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) is up more than +12% to lead gainers in the S&P 500, and Juniper Networks (JNPR) is up more than +8% after the Justice Department settled its lawsuit challenging HPE's takeover of Juniper Networks. Oracle (ORCL) is up more than +6% after Stifel upgraded the stock to buy from hold with a price target of $250. AppLovin (APP) is up more than +5% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 after UBS raised its price target on the stock to $540 from $475. Moderna (MRNA) is up more than +4% after saying its experimental flu shot met its goal in a late-stage trial.

Walt Disney Co (DIS) is up more than +1% after Jeffries upgraded the stock to buy from hold with a price target of $144.

ABCB,Jul-01-25 12:00PM,Ameris Bancorp (ABCB) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,https://finviz.com/news/93500/ameris-bancorp-abcb-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know,"Ameris Bancorp (ABCB) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system. Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ameris Bancorp basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock. Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Ameris Bancorp imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher. As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> . For the fiscal year ending December  2025, this bank  is expected to earn $5.35 per share, which is  unchanged compared with  the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ameris Bancorp. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.7%. Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of ""buy"" and ""sell"" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the next 15% get a ""Buy"" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn  more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Ameris Bancorp to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

ABEO,Jul-01-25 07:30AM,Abeona Therapeutics Announces Option Exercise by Beacon Therapeutics for Novel AAV204 Capsid for Ophthalmology Gene Therapy,https://finviz.com/news/92956/abeona-therapeutics-announces-option-exercise-by-beacon-therapeutics-for-novel-aav204-capsid-for-ophthalmology-gene-therapy,"Abeona will receive a license payment and potential development, regulatory, and sales milestones, and royalties CLEVELAND, July  01, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ABEO) today announced that Beacon Therapeutics, an ophthalmic gene therapy company and Syncona portfolio company, has exercised its option to license Abeona's patented AAV204 capsid for use in potential gene therapies for a range of prevalent and rare retinal diseases that result in blindness. This worldwide, non-exclusive license is pursuant to the agreement between Abeona and Beacon, announced in July 2024, to evaluate the therapeutic potential of AAV204. AAV204, a novel AAV capsid from the AIM™ capsid library licensed by Abeona from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has been shown to achieve high macular and optic nerve transduction levels after para-retinal administration and has also been shown to facilitate transduction of both the inner and outer retina after intravitreal administration in mice and non-human primates. “Beacon’s option exercise further validates AAV204’s potential to enable targeted delivery of gene therapies in rare and prevalent ophthalmic diseases,” said Dr. Madhav Vasanthavada, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Business Development at Abeona Therapeutics. “Our non-exclusive agreement with Beacon enables us to fully explore the therapeutic value of AAV204 in additional ophthalmic diseases.” The exercise of this license option concludes Beacon’s initial evaluation of the AAV204 capsid for development and commercialization of gene therapies and gives Beacon the right to use AAV204 in connection with up to five gene or ophthalmology disease targets. Under the terms of the agreement, Abeona will receive an undisclosed upfront license payment with additional payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and sales milestones, along with tiered royalties on worldwide net sales for licensed products incorporating AAV204. About the AIM™ capsid libraryThe AIM™ capsid library is a collection of novel AAV serotypes that target delivery of genetic payloads to key tissues implicated in devastating genetic diseases, including the central nervous system (including the retina), lungs, eye, muscle, liver and other tissues, with potentially improved tropism profiles. AIM™ vectors have shown the potential to evade the immune response generated by exposure to naturally-occurring AAV vectors in preclinical studies. AAV204 is covered by U.S. Patent Nos. 10,532,110 and 10,561,743.

ABEV,Jul-02-25 10:20AM,Constellation Brands' Stock Slips 1% on Q1 Earnings & Sales Miss,https://finviz.com/news/94441/constellation-brands-stock-slips-1-on-q1-earnings-sales-miss,"Constellation Brands, Inc.STZ reported first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s sales and earnings declined year over year. The results were mainly hurt by weak consumer demand trends, driven by non-structural socioeconomic factors.Comparable earnings per share (EPS) of $3.22 dropped 10% year over year in the fiscal first quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38. On a reported basis, the company’s EPS of $2.90 declined 39% year over year. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)Net sales declined 5.5% year over year to $2.52 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 billion.Constellation Brands’ stock declined 1.2% in the after-market trading session following the earnings release. The decline in share price can be attributed to the company’s dismal first-quarter fiscal 2026 top and bottom-line performances, and a bleak outlook. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 8.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 2%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Constellation Brands' sales for the beer business fell 2% year over year to $2.23 billion, backed by a decline of 3.3% in the shipment volume. The shipment decline resulted from socioeconomic headwinds, which led to soft consumer demand. Depletion volumes dipped 2.6% due to declines of 4%, just above 7% and 3% in Modelo Especial, Corona Extra and the Modelo Chelada brands, respectively. This was partly offset by more than 13% depletion growth for the Pacifico brand.Sales in the wine and spirits segment declined 28% year over year to $280.5 million in the fiscal first quarter. Sales were hurt by a 30.4% decline in shipment volumes and an 8.1% dip in depletions. Organic sales for the wine and spirits segment were down 21% in the quarter, led by a 13.3% improvement in shipment volume. The soft shipment volume was primarily driven by the SVEDKA divestiture and a strategic adjustment in shipment timing to better reflect ongoing weak consumer demand, particularly in the mainstream price segments of the U.S. wholesale market. Constellation Brands Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Constellation Brands Inc Quote STZ's comparable operating income was $810 million, down 11% from the prior-year quarter. The decline is attributed to the soft operating income in the beer, and wine and spirits businesses.Operating income for the beer segment fell 5% year over year to $873.4 million. The beer segment’s operating margin contracted 150 basis points to 39.1%, owing to higher COGS due to increased tariffs for aluminum, marketing investments and other SG&A. Additionally, lower fixed cost absorption benefits led to the margin contraction.The wine and spirits segment reported an operating loss of $6 million compared with an operating income of $59.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s operating margin contracted significantly due to lower contractual distributor payments and unfavorable variances linked to changes in volume-based contractual obligations, partially offset by marketing and other SG&A efficiencies.

ABL,Jul-02-25 03:06PM,"Coventry Responds to Baseless Lawsuit by Abacus Global Management, Inc.",https://finviz.com/news/94626/coventry-responds-to-baseless-lawsuit-by-abacus-global-management-inc,"FORT WASHINGTON, Pa.,July 2, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Coventry, the leader and creator of the secondary market for life insurance, today released the following statement: ""Abacus's (NASDAQ: ABL) lawsuit is its latest misdirection and a transparent ploy designed to delay accountability and deflect attention from serious problems of Abacus's own making,"" saidAlan Buerger, Coventry's Chairman. Coventry continues to believe that Lapetus systematically underestimates life expectancies, which directly threatens investor returns. This belief is validated by expert analysis that concluded exactly that. The studies are available athttps://www.coventry.com/research/. Abacus's complaint claims that none of its valuations for policies it owns depend on Lapetus's life expectancy estimates. The complaint also states that Abacus does not use a life expectancy valuation model to value the policies on its balance sheet, instead using ""market-based fair value accounting."" These claims contradict numerous statements Abacus has made inSEC filings, including that it ""utilizes a multitude of inputs to determine the fair value of the policies it holds, which may include life expectancy reports generated by a company in which [Abacus] holds a minority ownership interest"", i.e., Lapetus, and that ""[t]he valuation of life insurance policies will vary depending on the dates of the related mortality estimates and the medical underwriting firms that provide supporting information."" Similarly, aregistration statementfor Abacus's new fund offering discloses that it will use Lapetus as its ""primary life expectancy provider"" and that Lapetus ""provides the most conservative (i.e., longest) life expectancy predictions."" Contrary to what Abacus claims in its complaint, the registration statement is clear that ""following acquisition"" of a life insurance policy, the fund ""expects to utilize Lapetus Solutions as its primary life expectancy provider"" with respect to policy valuation. Abacus's SEC filings belie the notion that it does not use life expectancies to value policies post-acquisition. Finally, and contrary to Abacus's claims, Coventry had never heard of Morpheus Research before Morpheus published its initial short report on Abacus. Coventry is confident in the strength and integrity of its position and equally confident that Abacus's lawsuit has no merit. About Coventry Coventry is the leader and creator of the secondary market for life insurance. For more than 20 years, we have been driving the industry forward and expanding opportunities for life insurance policyowners. Coventry's deep experience combined with a fierce commitment to consumer rights makes Coventry the clear market leader, a position we use to raise industry standards and expand consumer choice.

ABL,Jul-01-25 04:10PM,Abacus Global Management Sues Coventry and its Chairman Alan Buerger for Defamation and Anticompetitive Conduct,https://finviz.com/news/93600/abacus-global-management-sues-coventry-and-its-chairman-alan-buerger-for-defamation-and-anticompetitive-conduct,"Coventry and Chairman Alan Buerger Engaged in Years-Long Campaign to Systematically Disseminate False and Misleading Information About the Publicly-Traded Company Coventry and Buerger Found a Key Partner and Megaphone for its Defamatory Statements: Short Seller Morpheus Research ORLANDO, Fla., July  01, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abacus Global Management, Inc. (“Abacus” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ABL), a leader in the alternative asset management space, today provided the following statement: Coventry First LLC, parent company of life settlements provider Coventry Direct (“Coventry”), and its Chairman Alan Buerger engaged in a concentrated effort to manipulate market sentiment about its biggest competitor, Abacus Global Management, through a systematic campaign to disseminate false and misleading statements about Abacus to regulators, auditors, market analysts, customers, investors and the public, causing confusion, concern, and financial injury to Abacus, its clients, and its shareholders, according to a lawsuit filed last night by Abacus in Florida’s Ninth Circuit Court. The lawsuit alleges that a short report published by Morpheus Research on June 4, 2025 was Coventry’s latest attack on Abacus. Coventry will be responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages should Abacus prove that Morpheus was acting as Coventry and Buerger’s willing partner and megaphone for the same defamatory statements Coventry was circulating about Abacus’ valuation methodology, statements regulators and market makers had ignored for months. Thelawsuitdetails a multi-year effort by Coventry and its Chairman and founder, Alan Buerger, to cast doubt on Abacus’ valuation practices and stock price. Unable to compete with Abacus’ transparent pricing model and performance, Coventry and Buerger devised a scheme to undermine Abacus through false and misleading statements to convince the market that Abacus pays policyholders too much for their policies, causing an overvaluation of Abacus’ assets. This is more than idle talk: they have tried to convince anyone who will listen that the biggest threat to Coventry’s business is in fact illegitimate. “This isn’t about competitive practices or even good faith criticism of a competitor’s business model – they clearly crossed the line into tortious interference and defamation,”said Abacus Global Management CEO Jay Jackson. “They’re losing market share to Abacus because we offer policyholders better terms and more transparent pricing, so instead of competing on product, they chose to try to manipulate markets by damaging Abacus’ reputation, confusing its customers, and undermining investor confidence with false statements. We’ve built a successful business through our fierce commitment to transparency – and we are going to fight back.” The lawsuit details the fundamental flaw at the center of Coventry’s false claims: Abacus buys policies from individuals​​and sells them to investors. When the policies are sold to investors, who conduct their own evaluation of the policies’ value, the sale price consistentlyexceedsAbacus’ valuations. In short, the market is thoroughly and indisputably corroborating the value of Abacus’ assets and debunking Coventry’s central premise. “Coventry's core claim is that top-tier investors like KKR are overpaying for life insurance policies—policies they've purchased from Abacus repeatedly over many years,” continued Abacus CEO Jackson. “Coventry essentially argues that they and Alan Buerger, with their less than sterling reputation, are more sophisticated investors than these major institutional firms. This claim is clearly absurd.” Coventry’s claim “deliberately ignores Abacus’ consistent and legally mandated disclosures that its publicly-traded balance sheet is valued ‘under the fair value method’ – that is, market price,” according to the filing. To convince the market that Abacus is not properly valuing its policies, Coventry targetedone of the sixlife expectancy estimate organizations Abacus uses, Lapetus Solutions. Coventry, and in particular Buerger, have “intentionally made false and misleading statements about Lapetus” through “purportedly independent but paid studies” that claim to show Lapetus systematically underestimates life expectancy. Coventry spread these false claims “across a wide range of audiences, each deliberately chosen to inflict maximum harm on Abacus,” including presenting its lies to: Abacus’s auditor, Grant Thornton; TD Securities, a market analyst tracking Abacus’ stock; the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and included the defamatory claims about Abacus in a lawsuit against the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (“OIR”). Coventry claims Abacus is using Lapetus to value the policies it holds on its balance sheet, thereby inflating the value of each policy based on inaccurate life expectancy estimates. But as the lawsuit explains, quoting public filings, Abacus has repeatedly disclosed that it “does not use a life expectancy valuation model to value the policies,” rendering the entire accusation meritless. Separately, Abacus uses Lapetus as one ofsixlife expectancy provider inputs when determining the price it will pay seniors for their policies, and not to derive its balance sheet valuations. If Coventry is correct that Lapetus is underestimating life expectancy, then it means Abacus is simply overpaying senior citizens for their policies. Abacus alleges that Coventry and Buerger recently “took these insinuations to the next level” when Buerger gave an interview, on the Tegus expert network platform, in which he accused Abacus of “manufactur[ing] earnings,” said that its “stockholders…will be subordinated to the asset-backed debt, which is to say they will all be wiped out when this thing goes upside down,” falsely repeating that Abacus, was “us[ing] Lapetus…primarily,” and predicting, “it’s just a matter of time before [Abacus] implodes.” The reality, found in the lawsuit filed today, is Abacus’s financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting have been found “in compliance with GAAP by a respected public company auditor in every annual audit,” that Abacus “has zero asset-backed debt” that can layer other investors in its capital structure, and that Abacus does not use Lapetus “to value the assets on its balance sheet, nor has it ever done so.” Coventry and Buerger also solicited “multiple short sellers to write a hit piece on Abacus, regurgitating the same false claims about Lapetus and Abacus’s valuation” with at least one prominent short seller who turned them down, noting “that senior citizens are makingtoo much moneyoff of selling their insurance policies is not a compelling story.” But eventually, Coventry and Buerger found a willing partner and megaphone for its defamatory statements: short seller Morpheus Research. Buerger’s interview was released to investors for the first time on June 4, 2025, 90 minutes before markets opened. Three hours later, Morpheus Research issued a short report that quoted Buerger’s most inflammatory accusations and heavily cited Coventry’s “research” on Lapetus. Within minutes, Abacus stock (NASDAQ: ABL) dropped more than 21%, erasing more than $200 million in market capitalization, based on well-trafficked lies. The lawsuit alleges Morpheus was acting as Coventry’s and Buerger’s willing partner and megaphone for the same defamatory statements about the Abacus valuation methodology, which regulators and market makers had ignored for months. The short report from Morpheus “parrots the same or similar false and misleading statements that Coventry had previously peddled.” As Morpheus acknowledges, one of its “sources” for the report includes “Abacus competitors,” a.k.a. Coventry, and ​​Morpheus timed the report to coincide with the release of Buerger’s Tegus interview. In the wake of Buerger’s interview and the report from Morpheus Research, Abacus is fielding questions from investors “parroting the points Coventry has been shilling for over a year,” and Buerger is “communicating directly with Abacus investors, and disseminating his misleading study of Lapetus.” The filing notes: “Coventry's relentless campaign against Abacus has caused substantial harm to the company and its shareholders. Coventry's false narrative attempts to project its own financial vulnerabilities onto Abacus, but the facts demonstrate otherwise. The market analysts who came to Abacus’ defense after the short report recognize the truth: Abacus’ transparent approach is a ray of sunshine in an otherwise beleaguered industry, and that explains its rapid rise.” Further, the lawsuit details how Coventry is “the poster child” for unsavory behavior in the industry, including: Abacus is represented in the lawsuit by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP. Abacus is seeking hundreds of millions in damages, some of which are still accruing, from the harms to its reputation, its customer base, and its relationships with current and potential investors.

ABL,Jun-30-25 08:00AM,Abacus Global Management Announces Commencement of Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation Relating to Warrants,https://finviz.com/news/91891/abacus-global-management-announces-commencement-of-exchange-offer-and-consent-solicitation-relating-to-warrants,"ORLANDO, Fla., June  30, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abacus Global Management, Inc. (“Abacus” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ABL), a leader in the alternative asset management space, today announced that it has commenced an exchange offer (the “Offer”) and consent solicitation (the “Consent Solicitation”) relating to its (i) outstanding public warrants (the “public warrants”) and (ii) outstanding private placement warrants (the “private placement warrants” and, together with the public warrants, the “warrants”) to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (“common stock”). The Company’s common stock and public warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “ABL” and “ABLLW,” respectively. The purpose of the Offer and Consent Solicitation is to simplify the Company’s capital structure and reduce the potential dilutive impact of the warrants, thereby providing the Company with more flexibility for financing its operations in the future. Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation Relating to Warrants The Company is offering to all holders of the outstanding warrants the opportunity to receive 0.23 shares of common stock in exchange for each warrant tendered by the holder and exchanged pursuant to the Offer. Pursuant to the Offer, the Company is offering up to an aggregate of 4,743,381 shares of its common stock in exchange for the warrants. The offering period will continue until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 29, 2025, or such later time and date to which the Company may extend (the “Expiration Date”), as described in the Company’s Schedule TO and Prospectus/Offer to Exchange (each as defined below). Tendered warrants may be withdrawn by holders at any time prior to the Expiration Date. Concurrently with the Offer, the Company is also soliciting consents from holders of the public warrants to amend the warrant agreement that governs all of the warrants (the “Warrant Agreement”) to permit the Company to require that each warrant that is outstanding upon the closing of the Offer be exchanged for 0.207 shares of common stock, which is a ratio 10% less than the exchange ratio applicable to the Offer (such amendment, the “Warrant Amendment”). Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, all except certain specified modifications or amendments require the vote or written consent of holders of at least 50% of the outstanding public warrants. Parties representing approximately 25% of our outstanding public warrants and 94% of our outstanding private placement warrants have agreed to tender their warrants in the Offer and to consent to the proposed Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation pursuant to tender and support agreements. Accordingly, if holders of an additional approximately 25% of our outstanding public warrants agree to consent to the Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation, and the other conditions described in the Offer and Consent Solicitation are satisfied or waived, then the Warrant Amendment will be adopted. The Offer and Consent Solicitation are being made pursuant to a prospectus/offer to exchange, dated June 30, 2025 (the “Prospectus/Offer to Exchange”), and Schedule TO, dated June 30, 2025 (the “Schedule TO”), each of which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and more fully sets forth the terms and conditions of the Offer and Consent Solicitation. As of June 30, 2025, there were (i) 97,867,821 shares of common stock outstanding and (ii) a total of 20,623,395 warrants outstanding, including 11,723,395 public warrants and 8,900,000 private placement warrants. Assuming all warrant holders tender their warrants for exchange in the Offer, the Company would expect to issue up to 4,743,381 shares of common stock, resulting in 102,611,202 shares of common stock outstanding (an increase of approximately 5%), and no warrants outstanding. D.F. King & Co., Inc. has been appointed as the information agent for the Offer and Consent Solicitation (the “Information Agent”), and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company has been appointed as the exchange agent (the “Exchange Agent”). Important Additional Information Has Been Filed with the SEC Copies of the Schedule TO and Prospectus/Offer to Exchange will be available free of charge at the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov. Requests for documents may also be directed to the Information Agent at (866) 796-3441 (for warrant holders) or (212) 257-2075 (for banks and brokers) or via the following email address:[email protected]. A registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the securities to be issued in the Offer has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. Such securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the warrants or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of common stock in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful before registration or qualification under the laws of any such state. The Offer and Consent Solicitation are being made only through the Schedule TO and Prospectus/Offer to Exchange, and the complete terms and conditions of the Offer and Consent Solicitation are set forth in the Schedule TO and Prospectus/Offer to Exchange. Holders of the warrants are urged to read the Schedule TO and Prospectus/Offer to Exchange carefully before making any decision with respect to the Offer and Consent Solicitation because they contain important information, including the various terms of, and conditions to, the Offer and Consent Solicitation. None of the Company, any of its management or its board of directors, or the Information Agent, or the Exchange Agent, makes any recommendation as to whether or not holders of warrants should tender the warrants for exchange in the Offer or consent to the Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation.

ABM,Today 06:00AM,The CEO of one of the largest office maintenance firms in America says employers are changing their workspaces in 4 key ways,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-one-largest-office-maintenance-100000300.html,"Scott Salmirs has a unique view of theRTO tug of warbetween workersand bossesthat has taken over American offices over the past few years. For 22 years, Salmirs has served as the CEO ofABM Industries, a company that maintains work spaces for more than half the companies on the Fortune 500. While it seems like the RTO battles havereached a plateau, with companies settling into ahybrid detente, Salmirs says the fight isn’t over;many CEOsare secretly hoping to add on another day to two of in-person work to employee schedules. That’s particularly true now that the labor market has shifted poweraway from workers, and back into the hands of bosses. “Thisreturn to office, it’s still happening, absolutely. I think with thiseconomic climate, we’ll really see what companies are thinking,” Salmirs tellsFortune. But there are a few key changes that businesses are making to their offices as they try to lure workers back, says Salmirs. Many large companies are cutting headcount and streamline operations; as a result, they’re trading in more outdated buildings for smaller, higher-quality spaces in centralized locations as a way to attract workers. They’re also ditching their open-plan offices and adding more private spaces to make the space “more hospitable,” he says. And of course, bosses are making sure that the pantries are fully stocked with snacks. “They’re looking closely at pantries and what they’re serving, including the coffee, the snacks, all that good stuff,” he says. “It really matters to employees.” Fortunesat down with Salmirs to discuss the future of office space and what workers can expect going forward. Fortune:What kinds of trends are you seeing when it comes to RTO? Salmirs: There’s been this commercial real estate crisis, if you will, about people not coming to work, and what’s going to happen with office buildings. Predominantly Class A buildings have been really resilient. As people are coming back, the benchmark now is a solid three to four days per week. Over the last 18 months, it’s been more and more. But the little-known fact about this more difficult time that we’re having right now economically, is that it gives management teams the ability, especially with the hiring market not being great, to ask workers to come back into the office more. Four years ago there was no way that a management team could tell people they’re coming back. they’ll just go get another job. Not so much now. What does the future of RTO look like? I think with this economic climate, we’ll really see what companies are thinking. It’ll be an incremental “one more day.” So if you’re at three, it’s going to be four, if you’re at four it could be five. This will be, in my mind, over the next six to nine months. We were promised anoffice apocalypsea few years ago, when people were saying that corporate real estate would be empty. What are you seeing in the market right now?We classify real estate into three buckets, class A, class B and class C. Class A is the good buildings, the ones with really good amenities, and those are doing great. I mean the leasing rates are off the hook, the occupancy rate is like 95%. It’s the B and C class spaces that are struggling a lot more. Say you have 20,000 square feet, and are in a class B building, paying $50 a square foot for rent. Now with not as many people coming in, you can pay $100 a foot for a 10,000 square foot building with top amenities in the best location because they know that if you want to get your people back to the office, you’ve got to give them good space. What are you seeing as the top priorities for companies right now when it comes to office space? I think it’s how they organize the space, because now that more people are coming back, there’s usually a shortage of private spaces. People used to want this big open plan where everyone was sitting at long desks. To get people back, companies are realizing that they have to give people some more privacy. So we’re seeing them convert open space into conference rooms, or areas with more secluded space. Also, they’re looking closely at pantries and what they’re serving, including the coffee, the snacks, all that good stuff. It really matters to employees. Since COVID, companies are also prioritizing clean spaces. We’re seeing a lot of [companies] making sure that they could say to employees that their workspace is healthy and clean. Some clients are moving some of our cleaning people on to the day staff, so they’re more visible, so people can see them cleaning and walking around the office. The most important thing is to really pay attention to people’s work habits. Are they working in groups collaboratively? Is it solo work? Are they on the phone a lot? Are they on video a lot? What we always say to our clients is that you really have to start with understanding the culture of the organization and the different use cases.

ABM,Jun-30-25 10:08AM,Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in ABM Industries Stock?,https://finviz.com/news/92309/is-the-options-market-predicting-a-spike-in-abm-industries-stock,"Investors inABM Industries IncorporatedABM need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 18, 2025 $25 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ABM Industries shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ABM Industries is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Business - Services industry that ranks in the Top 28% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 98 cents per share to 96 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about ABM Industries right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

ABNB,Jul-03-25 05:35PM,La Caisse firmly rejects allegations that it facilitates or encourages international crimes through its investments,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/la-caisse-firmly-rejects-allegations-213500501.html,"MONTRÉAL,July 3, 2025/CNW/ - Following the publication of the report by United Nations Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, La Caisse wishes to be clear and firmly rejects allegations that it facilitates or encourages international crimes through its investments. Allegations and facts must be corrected. For one, the majority of investments in the companies mentioned are not directly managed by La Caisse. They are managed by intermediaries or are held through standard products offered to all investors. Furthermore, La Caisse holds a very small percentage of shares in these companies, which limits its ability to directly influence them. In actual fact, it owns less than 0.1% of the majority of the companies identified. The rest are largely multinationals, such as Booking, Airbnb or Alphabet (Google), that are available and used all over the world and owned by a large number of investors. In addition, when La Caisse cannot exercise direct influence to encourage best practices, it does so through Federated Hermès, a globally recognized service provider specialized in shareholder engagement. We expect all of these companies to meet the highest standards wherever they operate. Lastly, La Caisse would like to reiterate that it has also ceased any new engagement inIsraeland the Occupied Palestinian Territories. La Caisse also reaffirms that it acts at all times in full compliance with all requirements of Canadian law and will continue to act in accordance with international standards on this matter wherever it operates. La Caisse takes its responsibilities as a global investor very seriously and is committed to continue operating according to the highest standards of human rights.

ABNB,Jul-01-25 04:20AM,"Golden Generation Travel Market Trends, Opportunity, and Forecasts to 2030: Key Players Like Hilton and Airbnb Lead the Charge in Reinventing Senior-Oriented Travel Experiences",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/golden-generation-travel-market-trends-082000097.html,"The Golden Generation Travel Market offers lucrative opportunities by catering to retirees with disposable income, seeking enriching, comfortable, and adventure-filled travel experiences. Providers can capitalize on wellness travel trends, offering accessible, premium, and health-focused services tailored to seniors' evolving preferences. Golden Generation Travel Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The""Golden Generation Travel Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F""has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.The Golden Generation Travel Market was valued at USD 8.74 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 14.84 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 9.28%. Growth is primarily fueled by a rising global retiree population, increased disposable incomes, and evolving lifestyle preferences among older adults. This demographic seeks comfort, enrichment, and adventure in their travel experiences, supported by advancements in travel planning technologies and improved global connectivity. Enhanced health awareness and the desire to maintain active lifestyles also drive demand for travel options tailored to the needs of seniors. With a growing appetite for meaningful experiences, the market presents ample opportunities for providers offering accessible, wellness-oriented, and premium travel services. Key Market Drivers: Increased Disposable Income and Financial Stability The financial independence and growing disposable income among individuals aged 55 and above serve as major catalysts for the Golden Generation Travel Market. Many seniors have accumulated substantial savings through pensions, investments, property appreciation, or inheritance. With fewer financial responsibilities such as child-rearing or mortgage payments, older adults are prioritizing leisure, particularly travel, to enhance their post-retirement lifestyle. This generation increasingly allocates resources to experiences, favoring quality and convenience. As a result, there is a strong market for guided tours, cruises, and premium accommodations tailored to this age group. Their willingness to pay for safety, comfort, and personalized service has prompted travel providers to develop curated offerings that meet the expectations of this financially stable and travel-enthusiastic demographic. Key Market Challenges: Health and Mobility Concerns Despite improved longevity, health and mobility issues remain significant barriers for senior travelers. Conditions such as chronic illnesses, limited stamina, and the need for continuous medication can restrict travel options. Long journeys, unfamiliar environments, and physically demanding activities may pose challenges and risks, especially in destinations with inadequate healthcare access or senior-friendly infrastructure. Emergencies abroad can be daunting due to language barriers and unfamiliar medical systems. Additionally, travel insurance becomes more costly or limited for seniors, particularly those with pre-existing conditions. Mobility concerns are compounded in areas lacking elevators, ramps, or accessible public transit. These limitations necessitate that travel providers design itineraries and services that account for medical needs, offer accessible facilities, and provide emergency support to ensure a safe and enjoyable travel experience. Key Market Trends: Rise of Wellness and Health-Focused Travel A prominent trend in the Golden Generation Travel Market is the rising interest in wellness-focused and health-enhancing travel experiences. Seniors increasingly seek out destinations and activities that contribute to physical and mental well-being. Wellness retreats, spa getaways, yoga workshops, and nutrition-centered holidays are becoming more popular. Nature-rich locations, therapeutic hot springs, and holistic resorts attract older travelers aiming to rejuvenate and sustain healthy routines. Medical tourism is also gaining momentum, with seniors combining affordable treatments like dental care or orthopedic procedures with leisurely travel. This trend reflects a dual focus on health and exploration. As wellness travel grows, industry players are responding with specialized packages, senior-accessible programs, and health consultations to meet evolving preferences for active, mindful, and restorative travel experiences.
