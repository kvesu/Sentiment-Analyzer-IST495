Its non-GAAP EPS of $1.31 per share was 3.6% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy A?Find out in our full research report (it’s free). Agilent’s second quarter results reflected broad-based growth across most end markets and geographies, with particular strength in China, India, and environmental testing. CEO Padraig McDonnell attributed the 6% year-on-year revenue growth to stable demand for core instruments, continued recovery in the biopharma segment, and robust performance in pathology and PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) testing. Management also highlighted progress in its digital ecosystem, noting a 12% increase in digital orders, and pointed to operational changes—including the Ignite transformation initiative—that drove early wins in pricing and procurement. While most end markets performed as expected, academia and government remained soft, and management described the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment as “highly dynamic,” underscoring ongoing uncertainty. Looking forward, Agilent’s guidance is shaped by ongoing tariff risks, a cautious approach to macroeconomic uncertainty, and confidence in its operational initiatives. Management maintained its full-year core growth and adjusted EPS outlook, citing the ability to offset incremental tariff costs through supply chain adjustments, pricing, and Ignite-driven efficiencies. CFO Bob McMahon noted, “A combination of supply chain moves, surcharges, and savings will allow us to fully mitigate tariff costs by next year.” The company expects continued momentum in PFAS testing, accelerating growth in its CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) segment, and further gains from newly launched products such as the Infinity III LC system and Seahorse XF Flex analyzer. However, management cautioned that near-term growth may be uneven given the dynamic external environment and timing of customer orders. Management pointed to diverse geographic and product performance, with China and environmental testing outpacing expectations, while transformative operational initiatives helped offset mounting tariff pressures. Agilent’s outlook for the coming quarters hinges on successful tariff mitigation, continued product innovation, and steady demand in core end markets, balanced against macroeconomic uncertainty. In the coming quarters, the StockStory team will watch for (1) sustained momentum in PFAS testing and CDMO segment order growth, (2) evidence that Ignite-driven cost savings and pricing actions are offsetting tariff impacts and supporting margin stability, and (3) the pace of customer adoption for new instruments like the Infinity III LC system. Progress in these areas will be key to tracking Agilent’s ability to navigate external headwinds and deliver on its operational commitments. Agilent currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 19.1×. Is the company at an inflection point that warrants a buy or sell?The answer lies in our full research report (it’s free).

Agilent Technologies Inc (NYSE:A) reported strong second-quarter results with revenue of $1.67 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. The company achieved an operating margin of 25.1% despite absorbing incremental tariff costs. Agilent's EPS grew by 7% compared to the second quarter of 2024, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. The company saw growth across all regions, with China leading at 10% growth, and strong performance in India with high teens growth. Agilent's PFAS testing business grew more than 70% year-over-year globally, contributing significantly to the company's growth. The academia and government end market declined modestly, with a 2% decrease in the quarter. Biopharma growth was slower, with low single-digit growth due to funding challenges in small and midsized biotech, primarily in the US. The company faced a mid-single-digit decline in its NGS business. Agilent had to absorb 55 basis points of incremental tariff costs, impacting gross margins. The company anticipates potential additional tariff impacts if US-EU tariffs increase, which could add $40 million in gross exposure in the second half of the year. Q: Can you provide insights into the order trends during the quarter, especially considering the impact of pharma tariffs?A: Padraig McDonnell, CEO, explained that the book-to-bill ratio was greater than one, with orders growing low single digits in Q2 and mid-single digits for the first half. There was no significant pull forward from pharma, and the business remained stable across regions. The consumables pull forward was offset by customs issues, which have now normalized. Q: How did the NASD and BIOVECTRA businesses perform, and what are the expectations for the rest of the year?A: Padraig McDonnell, CEO, and Simon May, President of Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group, noted high single-digit growth for NASD and high teens for BIOVECTRA. The businesses are well-positioned in advanced therapeutic modalities, with a clear line of sight to double-digit growth for NASD in the second half of the year. Q: What was the impact of the $15 million consumables pull forward in China, and how does it affect future quarters?A: Robert McMahon, CFO, explained that the pull forward was due to high tariff rates in China, leading to stocking of orders. This was offset by longer customs processing times for instruments. The overall revenue impact was neutral for Q2, and the situation is expected to normalize in Q3. Q: Can you discuss the impact of PFAS testing demand and its future prospects?A: Padraig McDonnell, CEO, highlighted a 75% year-over-year growth in PFAS testing, driven by strong demand in Europe and China. The market is expected to expand into industrial-based testing and volatile PFAS, with significant growth potential in the coming years. Q: How is the replacement cycle for the Infinity III LC systems progressing, and what is the outlook for GC systems?A: Padraig McDonnell, CEO, reported strong adoption and customer feedback for the Infinity III, with a growing order funnel and higher service and consumables attach rates. Mike Zhang, President of Applied Markets Group, noted significant opportunities in the GC and GC/MS replacement cycle, supported by new innovations and a large installed base.

This compares to earnings of $1.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.97%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this scientific instrument maker would post earnings of $1.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of 3.15%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Agilent The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Agilent shares have lost about 17.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 0.7%.   While Agilent has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.40 on $1.65 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.54 on $6.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the bottom 44% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Regrettably, Agilent’s sales grew at a mediocre 4.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the healthcare sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Agilent’s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 3% annually. We can better understand the company’s sales dynamics by analyzing its organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don’t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, Agilent’s organic revenue averaged 3% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see the company’s core operations (not acquisitions and divestitures) drove most of its results. This quarter, Agilent reported year-on-year revenue growth of 6%, and its $1.67 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 2.7%. Company management is currently guiding for a 5.2% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.8% over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend. Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. Agilent has been an efficient company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the healthcare sector, boasting an average operating margin of 21.5%. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Agilent’s operating margin rose by 1.7 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Zooming into its more recent performance, however, we can see the company’s margin has decreased by 2.6 percentage points on a two-year basis. If Agilent wants to pass our bar, it must prove it can expand its profitability consistently. This quarter, Agilent generated an operating profit margin of 18%, down 5.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Agilent’s EPS grew at a remarkable 11.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 4.8% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. We can take a deeper look into Agilent’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Agilent’s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 1.7 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also shrank by 8.7%, and these factors together are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth. In Q1, Agilent reported EPS at $1.31, up from $1.22 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 3.6%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Agilent’s full-year EPS of $5.40 to grow 7.7%. We enjoyed seeing Agilent beat analysts’ organic revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Adding to the good news, Agilent raised its full-year revenue guidance. Zooming out, we think this was a good quarter. The stock traded up 6.2% to $117.70 immediately following the results. So should you invest in Agilent right now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free.

AA,May-28-25 11:04AM,2025-05-28 11:04:00,Alcoa Rises 12.1% in a Month: Should You Buy the Stock Now or Wait?,https://finviz.com/news/68083/alcoa-rises-121-in-a-month-should-you-buy-the-stock-now-or-wait,"Shares ofAlcoa CorporationAA have been showing impressive gains of late, increasing 12.1% in the past month. The alumina, aluminum and bauxite products provider has outperformed the industry and S&P 500 composite’s growth of 11.3% and 4.3%, respectively. In contrast, the company’s peers,Constellium SECSTM andRyerson Holding CorporationRYI have gained 28.3% and lost 5.5%, respectively, over the same time frame. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Closing at $28.25 on Tuesday, the stock is trading below its 52-week high of $47.77 but higher than its 52-week low of $21.53. The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average (SMA) and below its 200-day SMA, indicating a mixed sentiment. Demand for aluminum has grown significantly over the years, with growing popularity for lighter and energy-efficient electric vehicles, recycled aluminum and rechargeable batteries. The increase in global air travel has prompted aircraft manufacturers to ramp up production, spurring demand for aluminum alloys for fuselages and wings.With the increase in aluminum demand, the tariffs on metals are gaining traction. The U.S. administration in March imposed 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum as a measure to correct trade imbalances and boost the domestic industry. The move has increased steel and aluminum prices, thereby benefiting domestic producers like Alcoa. However, it has not induced a revival in U.S. smelting, the energy-consuming process of aluminum production.A lack of access to competitively priced electricity in the US has led to several smelter closures in recent years, thereby affecting aluminum production. For instance, Alcoa permanently closed its 279,000 metric ton Intalco smelter in March 2023, which had remained idle since 2020. In the first quarter of 2025, AA’s third-party shipments of alumina declined 8%, while total shipments from the Aluminum segment decreased 5% on a sequential basis.Despite the challenges, the company’s Aluminum segment is benefiting from strong demand in the electrical and packaging end markets and continued progress on the Alumar, Brazil smelter restart. For 2025, AA expects the Aluminum segment to produce 2.3-2.5 million tonnes, while shipments are anticipated to be in the band of 2.6-2.8 million tonnes.Alcoa’s Alumina segment is witnessing the growing popularity of its Sustana line of products. Last year, AA announced its first sales of EcoSource non-metallurgical alumina. Also, its low-carbon EcoLum primary aluminum currently comprises half of its metal sales in Europe. For 2025, alumina production is anticipated to be in the range of 9.5-9.7 million tonnes, while shipments are likely to be 13.1-13.3 million tonnes.AA has announced several strategic actions over the past year to boost its organic growth and simplify its business portfolio. In August 2024, it acquired Alumina Limited, which enhanced its position as one of the world’s largest bauxite and alumina producers. The buyout is likely to provide Alcoa with long-term value creation due to greater financial and operational flexibility. Also, the company’s recent progress with stakeholders to improve the production capacity and long-term outlook of its San Ciprian site holds promise. Alcoa’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is indicative of its growth potential. ROE for the trailing 12 months (exiting first-quarter 2025) is 18.56%, higher than the industry’s 17.98%. This reflects the company’s efficient usage of shareholder funds. In terms of ROE, AA fares better than its peers, Constellium and Ryerson, which are pegged at 7.74% and (0.65%), respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 8.78X, which is below the industry average of 9.08X, Alcoa stock presents an attractive valuation for investors. Also, the stock is cheaper than Constellium and Ryerson, which are trading at 9.24X and 11.59X, respectively. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s earnings estimates for 2025 have decreased 13.1% to $3.57 per share over the past 60 days. Earnings estimates for 2026 have declined 19.2% to $2.69 per share. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Despite Alcoa’s several upsides and attractive valuation, the near-term challenges, such as rising electricity costs in the US affecting aluminum production and tepid earnings estimates, are limiting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s near-term prospects. While current shareholders should hold their positions, new investors should wait for the stock to retract some of its recent gains and provide a better entry point.You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
